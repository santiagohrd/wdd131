                <p>
                    Tigers are the largest members of the cat family. Known for their striking orange and black stripes, they are strong swimmers and often live near water. Sadly, they are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.

                <h3>Penguins</h3>
                <p>
                    Penguins are flightless birds that thrive in cold environments, particularly Antarctica. They are excellent swimmers, using their wings to "fly" underwater while hunting for fish. Penguins live in colonies, providing warmth and safety.

                <p>
                    Hummingbirds are tiny, colorful birds known for their ability to hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings. They are the only birds capable of flying backward and play a critical role as pollinators for plants.
